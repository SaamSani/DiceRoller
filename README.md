# DiceRoller ðŸŽ²

A simple web-based dice game where two players roll dice to see who wins. The game randomly generates two dice rolls (for Player 1 and Player 2), and the highest roll wins. If both rolls are the same, it's a draw!

## How It Works

- On each refresh of the page, two dice are rolled.
- The result will display at the top of the page:
  - ðŸš© **Player 1 Wins!** if Player 1 rolls a higher number.
  - **Player 2 Wins! ðŸš©** if Player 2 rolls a higher number.
  - **Draw!** if both players roll the same number.

## Project Files

- **index.html**: The main file that contains the structure of the game (HTML).
- **styles.css**: Contains the styles for the game (CSS).
- **index.js**: Contains the logic for the dice rolls and result display (JavaScript).
- **images/**: A folder containing images of the dice (dice1.png to dice6.png).

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. The game automatically rolls the dice when the page loads or refreshes.
3. The winner or a draw message will be displayed at the top.
